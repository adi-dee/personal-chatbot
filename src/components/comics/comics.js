          <p>Full length graphic novel illustrated and written by me, inspired by the time I lived in jerusalem. The controversial city is historically famous for fanatic wars in the name of god. A jewish underground group attacked and killed soldiers of the british colonial army in the 40â€™s, on the king david hotel army base. This days when similar actions, when done from the Palestinian side, are called out as terror attacks. After learning about israel historical events, I come to ask, who is a freedom warrier and who is a terrorist. </p>
