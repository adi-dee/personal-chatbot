<h3>motivation</h3>
<p>
Based in Berlin, Adi Aviram is a web developer and illustrator (digital and traditional).
As a multi interest artist she likes to explore and combine different techniques and skills which include writing, design, illustration and creative coding.
Adi studied visual communication and worked as a designer and comics creator and after she got the chance to learn web development and work as a commercial developer she explores the combination of illustrative art and creative coding. These days she works as a developer and illustrator for the Berlin based design software Vectornator.
In her works she uses illustrative motifs and visual communication to create a modern storytelling experience.
Adi finds her inspiration in ancient and modern storytelling such as her roots, jewish folklore stories, and science fiction. Using the world wide web as her canvas she creates an engaging experience and takes the passive viewer to the front of the seat in her works.
